title = 'Love what you used to hate'

 My whole life I have been good on learning new things, normally I can quickly grab new concepts and apply them so this ability gets absorbed faster on my brain however despite being or at least considered myself a quick learner it is almost unavoidable sometimes to overstimate how hard some stuff are really to learn. I hope you know what I am talking about, that subject or knowledge domain that seems too daunting or for some past bad experiences you feel you will never learn and that internal talking it is both dangerous for your own growth and most of the time a false narrative.

 ## You love the song you used to hate

 I remember a lot that when I was growing up in Colombia my english classes at school consisted almost exclusively on learning and singing in front of everyone a popular song. Yeah pretty much torture for a group of little kids, you read a song and repeat by pure vocal mechanical memory a song with around 30 people that were not even considered teenagers at the time. The pressure and social anxiety made hate songs widely recognized as anthems of the pop culture such as Hotel California.

 Hotel California it is a complety anthem, almost everybody knows it or can recognize it, however while growing up I hated it. I hated it more for what it maded feel rather than any logical reason, fortunately people grow, change and live stuff that turns you into a different and hopefully version of themselves, of course that was my change and in 2022 Hotel California rank in top 5 in my Spotify wrapped since one glorius day the algorithm put it in front of my again, I **resisted** the temptation of playing the next song so now it is one of my favorites songs.

 This came from going to the initial struggle of first realizing that my prejuices about the song came from the struggle gave me in school and not from an untackable complexity or from a limitation on my learning skills. To after realize that if I go through this initial discomfort I can learn to enjoy the song and learn it to individually undestarnd its **components** and later on composed them as a whole and it is in this point where what before supposed a struggle can become something that you actually enjoy.

 ## Break down and compose

The complexity of the subjects comes from its **whole**. Most of human domains knowledge are the composition of different principles, concepts and techniques which as a its whole represent complexity mostly from how many parts are involved and the interaction between them, here it is where we stumble, on this paralisis of seeing the giant wave in front of us, on seeing the giant task that this learning endevour represent instead of taking a pause and tackle this complexity **locally**, divide the problem in their individual parts, figuring them out individually and see how they make sense together, tackling it this way makes the undertanding way easier since you don't hold the whole complexity in your brain at once and as an adition the effort to understand the components and their composition points makes the understandind deeper.
