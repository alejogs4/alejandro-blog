 Throughout my life, I’ve always been good at learning new things. Usually, I can quickly grasp new concepts and apply them, allowing the knowledge to click relatively fast. However, despite being—or at least considering myself—a quick learner, it is almost unavoidable to sometimes overestimate how hard some subjects truly are. I hope you know the feeling: that subject or domain that seems too daunting, or perhaps a past bad experience that makes you feel you’ll never master it. That internal monologue is both dangerous for your growth and, most of the time, a false narrative.

 ## You love the song you used to hate

 I remember clearly that when I was growing up in Colombia, my English classes consisted almost exclusively of learning and singing a popular song in front of the class. It was pretty much torture for a group of kids—reading lyrics and repeating a song through pure mechanical memory alongside 30 other people who weren't even teenagers yet. The pressure and social anxiety made me hate songs widely recognized as pop culture anthems, such as "Hotel California".

 "Hotel California" is a complete anthem; almost everyone knows it or can recognize it. However, while growing up, I hated it. I hated it more for how it made me feel rather than for any logical reason. Fortunately, people grow, change, and experience things that turn them into a different—and hopefully better—version of themselves. In 2022, "Hotel California" ranked in the top five of my Spotify Wrapped. One glorious day, the algorithm put it in front of me again; I **resisted** the temptation to skip and now it is one of my favorite songs

 This change came from pushing through the initial struggle. I first realized that my prejudices about the song came from my struggles in school, not from some untouchable complexity or a limitation in my learning skills. I realized that if I moved through that initial discomfort, I could learn to enjoy the song and **understand its individual components**. Eventually, I could compose them back into a whole. It is at this point that what once felt like a struggle becomes something you actually enjoy.

 ## Build vocabulary

I once had a conversation with my flatmate (Hello Mai), who specializes in [coaching parents](https://www.mailensteinbrenner.com/) on how to consciously raise emotionally stable and resilient kids. You can imagine that psychology is a common conversation topic at home. Something she told me once is that people from older generations often felt something but didn't have the vocabulary to describe it—they didn't know what name to put to that pressure in their chest.

In the same way that we cannot describe how we feel if we don't have the words, we cannot understand a topic if its basic vocabulary is unknown to us. When working with software, you must know what a "variable" is or what an "object" means in a given context. Knowing the domain vocabulary gives you the building blocks to comprehend information faster. From that foundation, you can go deeper into the domain, taking advantage of semantic knowledge as a base to learn something new.

 ## Break down and compose

The complexity of a subject comes from its **whole**. Most domains of human knowledge are a composition of different principles, concepts, and techniques. The "complexity" is mostly a result of how many parts are involved and how they interact. This is where we stumble—in the paralysis of seeing a giant wave in front of us. We see the massive scale of the learning endeavor instead of pausing to tackle that complexity **locally**.

By dividing the problem into individual parts, we can figure them out one by one and see how they make sense together. Tackling it this way makes understanding much easier because you aren't trying to hold the entire complexity in your brain at once. Additionally, the effort to understand the components and their composition makes your understanding deeper.

In software and mathematics, this is common knowledge. We are always told to divide problems into easier-to-tackle sub-problems, solve them individually, and finally compose those sub-solutions into an entire solution. We don't just do this for physical or computing performance—sometimes it’s the opposite—but because humans have a limited "context window," similar to an LLM. We cannot easily grasp everything at once if we haven't yet formed the neuronal connections that make complete understanding possible.


## Transferable knowledge: the base of versatility

I don't know if this has always been true in the tech industry, but it certainly has been over the last decade: we tend to always chase the "new shiny thing." We easily fall into the trap of perceiving new tools as replacements for our usual workflows. This FOMO generates a kind of collective hysteria, or phenomena like [Javascript fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4). For those who don't remember, there was a span of about seven years—from the ES2015 release until the AI hype—where new capabilities in the world’s most used programming language led the community to build countless frameworks and libraries. Entire stacks and projects were rebuilt under the often false promise of better maintainability and performance.

The problem with jumping from tool to tool is that people get distracted by details and forget that wisdom lies in the foundations. Those foundations provide the criteria for making decisions that actually affect projects in the long term. Foundations are transferable knowledge that makes every transition smoother. If you understand the high-level mechanics of HTTP, building HTTP clients or servers becomes much easier. If you know why information hiding is a key software design principle, the "REST vs. GraphQL" debate becomes much simpler to navigate.

The key is to optimize for career versatility. Focus on transferable and transversal knowledge—the concepts that will survive the passing of time and technological breakthroughs better than over specializing in specific tools. Specific tools evolve so fast that your knowledge can become irrelevant without a constant, exhausting hustle.

## A word against specialization

Specialization is important; it’s one of the pillars of why we work well as a society. I am a better engineer than I would be a baker, chef, or accountant. However, where do we draw the line? At what point are we tying our time and effort to a world of details rather than a world of foundations?

I have seen this many times: people focus so heavily on a single tool that their professional identity becomes tied to it. We love to say "the right tool for the problem" because it sounds good, but that’s often not how we actually work. Why? Because when over-specialization hits, you only have one way of thinking and one way of resolving problems, a single tool.

Overspecialization pays off until it doesn't—until technological progress forces you to update your skills and you discover the transition is difficult. It’s harder if you haven't nurtured breadth because of an over-emphasis on depth.

I’m not saying you shouldn't focus on learning some things better and deeper than others. But be cautious when saying "I don't need to learn this" regarding a foundational skill. Those skills provide the versatility to move from one domain to another and build the mental models needed to make better decisions.
