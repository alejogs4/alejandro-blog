Some years ago one of the tech leads I have respected the most on my career (Hello Yuji) said something that from that moment resulted in a mantra for me:

> For bad software we already have Excel

With this he didn't mean Excel was a bad software, it is and it continues being one of the most incredible pieces of software ever written however most of what we build even for serious projects is not even close to this level of refinenment, uselfulness and robustness but why this happens? why our industry even with the most potent tools ever conceived it seems to always fail to build software products that even just justify its own existance? let's talk about **communication**.

## Broken telephone game: our ability to say what we mean

As children in school and as adults in corporate trainings we don't want to attend you might have played the broken telephone game, in this game `n` group of persons try to pass a message from the first person to the last person trying to keep as much as possible the integrity of the first message, the result almost always is that the message get's at some level changed from the original message, depending of how much this message was changed this is more serious or it is simply a small inconvenience and this message changing it is because humans are bad at saying literally what other people said to them so using their our language, vocabulary and ways of expressing we tend to replicate what we heard however in this human-to-human translation some original meaning it is lost so when multiply across several chain of people exist a high probability than the original message it is not transmited as was originall intended and for our bad luck this happens not only in day to day communication, this happens in our jobs where the effectiveness and clarity of our words it is a big factor in the success of software products we build.
