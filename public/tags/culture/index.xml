      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago one of the tech leads I have respected most in my career said something that became a mantra for me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For bad software we already have Excel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this he didn&amp;rsquo;t mean Excel was bad software—it is and it continues to be one of the most incredible pieces of software ever written. However, most of what we build even for serious projects is not even close to this level of refinement, usefulness, and robustness. Why does this happen? Why does our industry, even with the most potent tools ever conceived, seem always to fail to build software products that even just justify their own existence? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;strong&gt;communication&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
